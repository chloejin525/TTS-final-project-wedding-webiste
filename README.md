# Personal Wedding Website Project

This is an ongoing side project that started as the capstone project for the Code Immersion Program at Tech Talent South. 

It is an interactive wedding website where: 
  * The guests can view the wedding information, purchase registry items, RSVP and interact with other guests
  * The bride and groom can view and manage RSVP and registry
